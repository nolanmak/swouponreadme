# Swoupon Tokenomics Calculation Library

This repository contains the Solidity implementation and reference calculations for the Swoupon tokenomics framework. Swoupon is a liquidity pool rewards system designed to incentivize swappers in decentralized exchanges.

## Overview

Swoupon introduces an innovative approach to liquidity pool incentives by creating a balanced economic system where:

- Swappers pay a dynamic fee (`TR`) based on their swap volume
- Swappers receive reward tokens (`TI`, or "Swoupons") that can be used to pay for future swap fees
- Swoupons are only issued for transactions that are not already paid with Swoupons
- The system automatically adjusts to market conditions through volume-dependent calculations

The core principle is to create a sustainable economic model where users are incentivized to continue using the protocol by earning Swoupons on one swap that they can redeem on future swaps, creating a virtuous cycle of engagement.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Fee Structure**: Fees decrease as volume increases, incentivizing larger swaps
- **Swoupon Rewards**: Users earn Swoupons on regular swaps that they can redeem for future swap fees
- **Reward Cycle**: Only swaps paid with regular fees (not with Swoupons) generate new Swoupon rewards
- **Fixed-Point Math**: All calculations use 64.64 fixed-point arithmetic for precise on-chain execution
- **Gas Optimized**: Calculations are designed to be efficient for on-chain execution

## Mathematical Model

The Swoupon system is built on several key mathematical functions:

### 1. Fee Factor Function F(V)

This function calculates a dynamic fee factor that decreases as volume increases:

$$F(V) = 0.01 + (0.02 \cdot e^{-0.00005 \cdot V})$$

Where:
- $V$ is the swap volume
- The fee factor ranges from 0.03 (at $V=0$) to 0.01 (as $V$ approaches infinity)

### 2. Swoupon Cost TR(V)

This function calculates the cost charged for a swap of volume $V$:

$$TR(V) = \frac{F(V) \cdot V}{0.1}$$

This represents the amount of fees a user would pay for a swap, or alternatively, the amount of Swoupons they would need to spend if using Swoupons for the transaction.

### 3. Potential Swoupon Reward TI(V)

This function calculates the potential Swoupon reward a user would receive when making a swap paid with regular fees (not with Swoupons):

$$potential\_TI(V) = \frac{(1 + V)^{0.3}}{0.1}$$

*Note: The Solidity implementation uses $\sqrt{1+V}$ which approximates the original model's target of $(1 + V)^{0.3}$ due to limitations in the fixed-point library.*

### 4. Final Swoupon Reward TI(V)

The actual Swoupon reward issued, capped at a fraction of the cost:

$$TI(V) = \min(potential\_TI(V), \frac{TR(V)}{3})$$

This ensures that rewards never exceed one-third of the fees collected, maintaining economic sustainability. These Swoupons can then be used to pay for future swap fees.

## Implementation Details

### Solidity Implementation

The core calculations are implemented in `contracts/CalcLib.sol` using the [ABDKMath64x64](https://github.com/abdk-consulting/abdk-libraries-solidity) library for fixed-point arithmetic. The implementation includes:

- Fixed-point constants for all mathematical parameters
- Helper functions for min/max operations
- Core calculation functions for F(V), TR(V), and TI(V)
- Combined calculation function for efficiency

### Fixed-Point Constants

```solidity
// 0.01 * 2^64 = 184467440737095516
int128 private constant C_0_01 = 184467440737095520;
// 0.02 * 2^64 = 368934881474191032
int128 private constant C_0_02 = 368934881474191040;
// -0.00005 * 2^64 = -922337203685477
int128 private constant C_NEG_0_00005 = -922337203685477;
// 0.1 * 2^64 = 1844674407370955161 (approx)
int128 private constant C_0_1 = 1844674407370955264;
// 1/3 * 2^64 = 6148914691236517205 (approx)
int128 private constant MAX_TI_FRACTION = 6148914691236516864; // 1/3
// 1 * 2^64 = 18446744073709551616
int128 private constant C_ONE = 18446744073709551616;
```

## Python Reference Implementation

A Python reference implementation is provided in `python/swoupon_calc.py` for simulation and testing purposes. This implementation:

- Uses NumPy for mathematical operations
- Provides the same core functions as the Solidity implementation
- Includes test cases and verification logic
- Uses the exact $(1 + V)^{0.3}$ formula for potential TI calculation

## Testing

The Solidity implementation is thoroughly tested using Hardhat:

- Unit tests for all calculation functions
- Comparison against pre-calculated values from the Python implementation
- Edge case testing for V=0 and other boundary conditions
- Precision testing with appropriate tolerances

## Visualization

The following chart illustrates how TR and TI scale with volume:

## Development

This project uses Hardhat for Solidity development:

- **Setup**: `npm install`
- **Compile**: `npx hardhat compile`
- **Test**: `npx hardhat test`

## Integration

To integrate this library into your project:

1. Import the `CalcLib.sol` contract
2. Use the calculation functions to determine fees and rewards based on swap volume
3. Ensure your contract has access to the ABDKMath64x64 library
